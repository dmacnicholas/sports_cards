## Overview

[Relational Rails](https://github.com/dmacnicholas/sports_cards) is a week solo project during Mod 2 of Turing School's Back-End Engineering program.

The goal was to create a functioning Rails Application that can take users through a website and give them the ability to Create, Read, Update, and Destroy data while being able to view the changes on the website (Rails Application).

## Learning Goals

Learning goals and areas of focus consisted of:
- Design a One-to-Many relationship using a schema designer
- Write migrations to create tables with columns of varying data types and foreign keys.
- Use Rails to create web pages that allow users to CRUD resources
- Create instance and class methods on a Rails model that use ActiveRecord methods
- Write model and feature tests that fully cover data logic and user behavior

The project home page and requirements can be found [here](https://backend.turing.edu/module2/projects/relational_rails).

## Tools Used
 - Ruby 2.7.4
 - Rails 5.2.8
 - RSpec (capybara, orderly, shoulda matchers, simplecov)
 - PostgreSQL
 - Postico
